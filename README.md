Doing data science stuff (classify iris dataset) using nearly from scratch codebase using python language

This project is originally for Pattern Recognition Class Final Project, Electro & Instrument, DCSE UGM
I implement simple machine learning algorithm, in this case Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for classifying iris dataset. I also implement manually classification report based on mathematical formula.
